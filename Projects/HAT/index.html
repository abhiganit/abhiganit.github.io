<p>
Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), which is fatal if left untreated,
continues to present a serious health risk to humans in vast regions
of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by two sub-species of the
protozoan parasite <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> (<i>T.b.</i>), and is transmitted by
tsetse flies. The sub-species, <i>T.b. gambiense</i>, is responsible for the
majority of reported cases of HAT, and is transmitted by tsetse
flies. Over the last decade, expanded control efforts have led to a
decline in the number of new HAT cases, spurring the WHO to include
<i>T.b. gambiense</i> HAT on its roadmap for 2020 elimination.
</p>

<p>
To inform implementation of WHO's elimination goal, it is imperative
to understand the likelihood of whether the control interventions are
sufficient and, if not what other complementary strategies would
synergistically facilitate achieving the 2020 target.
</p>

<p>
We developed a <a href="#Model">mathematical model for Gambian HAT</a> to evaluate vector
control as well as screen and treat strategies. We will calibrate our
model to data from  various "foci of infection" such that they vary in
terms of transmission intensity or/and ecological settings. Currently,
we are trying to use data from Boffa, Guinea which is classified as
"medium transmission intensity" foci and where livestock play a
limited role in HAT transmission cycle.
</p>


<p>
A brief introduction to various aspects of Gambian HAT and tsetse fly follows:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Gambian HAT</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Gambian HAT is caused by <i>T.b.gambiense</i> and transmitted by the
<i>Palpalis</i>-group species of tsetse, particularly subspecies of
<i>Glossina fuscipes</i> and <i>Glossina palpalis</i>. This group of tsetse
is commonly known as <b>riverine tsetse</b> and generally infest
relatively humid habitats fringing the rivers, lake shores and
wetlands of West and Central Africa.
</p>

<p>
The disease progress over several years from the initial symptoms
of fever, headaches and lymphadenopathy (Stage I) through
neuropsychiatric disorders (Stage II) and sleep disturbance (hence
the name) and in most cases death.

<div id="fig:ModelFits" class="figure">
<p><img src="tsetse.jpg" alt="tsetse.jpg" align="right" height="250px" width="250px" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In contrast to other vectors like mosquitoes, blackflies and
sandflies, both sexes of tsetse rely exclusively on blood for all
their nutritional needs. Tsetse become infected after feeding on an
infected host. The trypanosomes undergo a complex process of
maturation in the fly and after a period of about 20-40 days the
infective forms appear in the salivary glands of the fly which,
thereafter remains potentially infective to any humans it
bites. Most flies are inherently refractory to infection and even
those that are not refractory to infection are most susceptible
during their first blood meal.
</p>

<p>
Tsetse have an unusual form of reproduction, termed adenotrophic
viviparity, in which the larva develops within the female. From the
age of about 6 days, adult females produce a single egg which
matures in the uterus for about 7-12 days, the duration being
dependent of temperature. A single mature third-stage larva is
deposited by the female on loose soil and it burrows into the
ground and pupates. The time to deposition for subsequent larvae is
shorter than for the first offspring and the time between
offspring decreases with increasing temperature. A mature adult fly
emerges 20-40 days after deposition and this pupal duration also
decreases with increasing temperature. This resultant low rate of
reproduction is only sustainable because of relatively long life
span of tsetse flies.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><i>Mortality</i></b>: In one field study, female mortality was about 10%
per day in newly emerged flies, fell to about 2% by age 10 days,
increasing slowly thereafter. The pattern was similar for male
but mortality increased much more rapidly with age. The changes
relate to low-fat levels and poorly developed flight musculature
in newly emerged flies, resulting in the double difficulty of
needing to find and feed on a host rapidly but with a limited
flight capacity. Accordingly, many young tsetse flies either die
of starvation, or by attempting to feed off high-risk hosts such
as humans. Those that do feed successfully build up energy
reserves and flight muscles, and subsequent mortality
declines. Increased mortality in older flies is associated with
increased wing wear resulting in diminished flight
capacity. Adult mortality also increases with temperature and may
be up to six times as high in the hot part of the year as in the
cool part.
</li>
<li><b><i>Abundance and distribution</i></b>: Tsetse populations are able to
persist at remarkably low densities. Obtaining reliable estimates
of absolute densities of tsetse for sparse populations is
difficult, but it seems likely that they can survive at densities
of 1 tsetse/km<sup>2</sup> or less, while maximum densities seems to be in
order of 10,000 tsetse/km<sup>2</sup>.
Tsetse are highly mobile, moving up to 1 km per day. For the more
typical habitats of riverine tsetse, flies are confined to the
vegetation fringing rivers and lakes and hence displacement is
largely along river margins and lake shores. The important
consequence of the high mobility of tsetse is that populations of
tsetse are seldom isolated and hence migration of tsetse into and
out of an HAT focus is the norm.
</li>
<li><b><i>Feeling interval</i></b>: Male and females are obligate blood feeders
obtaining meals at 2-5 day intervals. The blood meal provides all
of the fly's requirements for energy, water and growth, including
production of larvae. Hence for tsetse, it imperative to find and
feed on a host regularly to avoid starvation. The defensive
behavior of hosts and predatory insects (e.g. Asilidae (robber or
assassin flies) and Bembicidae (a family of wasps)) in the host
vicinity also pose a risk to feeding tsetse.
</li>
<li><b><i>Host selection</i></b>: Tsetse use a combination of olfactory and
visual cues to locate their hosts. In general savannah tsetse
feed on Suidae and Bovidae, particularly warthog and buffalo in
wilderness area and cattle where they are present. Humans are
rarely bitten by savannah tsetse; odours and visual stimuli
produced by humans are repellant and those who do bite humans
tend to be young and/or in an advanced stage of
starvation. Riverine tsetse have broader range of hosts which can
include primates, Suidae, Bovidae and reptiles, particularly the
Nile monitor lizard. Humans are not repellent to riverine tsetse
and as a consequence, humans can form an important part of their
diet.
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Trypanosome biology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The latent period between initial inoculation of <i>T.brucei</i> and a
mammalian host becoming infectious is about 7-14 days. The
duration of subsequent infection ranges between several months and
years and is strongly right-skewed with some cases persisting for
many years without morbidity or death. The mean duration for stage
I is 17 months and for stage II is 16 months. Severe illness and/or
hospitalization during stage II may effectively remove the human
host from the population of hosts by preventing contact with tsetse
flies, in which case the mean duration of infectiousness would be
17 months.
</p>

<p>
The probability of a fly being infected depends not only on the
levels of parasitaemia in the host but also the age, nutritional
condition, sex and species of the fly itself. The 'teneral
effect'. Newly emerged unfed tsetse ('teneral' flies) that are
typically less than 3 days old are much more susceptible to
infection with subspecies of <i>T.brucei</i> at their first blood meal
than older flies.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Control for Gambian HAT</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Due to the absence of a vaccine, intervention strategies against
HAT rely on vector control and on active and passive case detection
followed by treatment. These two strategies were initially
effective, and the disease was nearly eradicated in the early
1960s. However, a collapse of surveillance and control activities
int he endemic countries, often due to periods of political
instability, led to progressive re-emergence of the disease since
early 1990s.
</p>

<p>
Since the resurgence of HAT, expanded control activities has
facilitated an overall decline in the number of new cases of HAT
being reported to WHO annually. The achievements of the past 20
years have been realized almost exclusively through active case
detection and treatment. Screening of the population is based on
the use of Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis followed by
staging of positive cases through examination of the cerebrospinal
fluid which involves a lumbar puncture.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the drugs used to treat Gambian HAT are <b>pentamidine</b>
for stage I and <b>nifurtimox-eflornithine</b> combination therapy for
stage II. While vector control has not been an important part of
efforts against Gambian sleeping sickness, the recent development
of cost-effective methods to control riverine tsetse suggests that
tsetse control will form an important part of efforts to eliminate
Gambian HAT in the future.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Usefulness of HAT models</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
The few models of HAT that exist suggest that elimination of HAT
will not require killing the last fly or finding and treating the
last case. Rather, reducing the mean infectious period of humans
through case detection and treatment, and reducing the longevity
and density of tsetse flies through vector control may eliminate
transmission. There are many questions that HAT models can be used
to answer:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What percentage of a human population needs to be screened and
treated to eliminate a focus of Gambian HAT transmission ?
</li>
<li>At what frequency should such a screen and treat program be
repeated ?
</li>
<li>What deduction in the density and longevity of tsetse flies is
required to eliminate transmission of HAT ?
</li>
<li>How long must interventions be applied to eliminate a focus ?
</li>
<li>Why is HAT not more widespread, and will movement of reservoir
hosts, tsetse or infected humans cause it to spread ?
</li>
<li>How does HAT persist at the low levels of prevalence that have
been measured in humans and tsetse flies ?
</li>

  Birth and death rate: We take birth rate for tsetse (B<sub>V</sub>) to be
constant, whereas the death rate to be increasing quadratic to
measure the effect of intra-species competition on death rate:
\[\mu_V = \mu_{V_0} (1+\mu_{V_1}V) \]
where &mu;<sub>V<sub>0</sub></sub> is the death
rate in the absence of intra-species competition, while &mu;<sub>V<sub>1</sub></sub>
measures the effect of intra-species competition on death
rate.
</li>

<li><b>Vector Control</b>:
The vector control methods to be considered are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Traps, Insecticide</i>
</li>
<li><i>Sterilized male release</i>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Human Dynamics:</b>
 Humans become infected when bitten by an infected tsetse with
probability &beta;<sub>H</sub>, incubate for a period of 1/&tau;<sub>H</sub> , and then
are stage I infectious. Without treatment individuals in stage I
progress to stage II after a duration of 1/&gamma;<sub>H<sub>1</sub></sub> and dies
after a duration of 1/&gamma;<sub>H<sub>2</sub></sub> if  left untreated in stage II.
We assume that only tsetse become infected only after biting stage I
infectious individuals as stage II infectious are severely ill at
home or hospital and thus hardly come in contact with tsetse. /The
foci of infection for Gambian HAT that we are considering are from
rural areas and it may be reasonable to assume that the population
is stable and so we assume population to be constant by making rate
birth rate equal to the natural and disease/treatment induced death
rates.
</li>
<li><b>Human Treatment:</b> Case detection and treatment still remains one
of the primary methods of controlling gambiense HAT. The case
detection is conducted by active case-finding through mobile teams
or when patients visit health structures (passive case finding).
In our model, the rate at which an infectious individual in any
stage receive treatment depends on efficacy and coverage of
treatment. The coverage of treatment at stages I and II is defined
by parameters &phi;<sub>1</sub> and &phi;<sub>2</sub> as
\[ \phi_i = P_i P_{i+/D} P_{iT/+}\]
where for i = 1, 2, P<sub>i</sub> is the probability that a stage i patient
gets a CATT test, P<sub>i+/D</sub> is sensitivity of the diagnostic tests
that is the probability that a stage i patient gets a positive CATT
test and a positive parasitology test, and P<sub>iT/+</sub> is the
probability that a stage i patient gets treatment after getting
positive CATT test and a positive parasitology test. <br  />
  A stage I patient remains in stage I and later progresses to stage
II in case of treatment failure. Similarly, treatment failure in
stage II results into patient either remaining stage II infectious
and later dying due to the disease or dying due to the side effects
of the stage II treatment with a rate of p<sub>2</sub>.
</li>
<li><b>Livestock Dynamics:</b> Livestocks are modeled similar to humans, but
only one infectious class is considered. Livestock can become
infected after being bitten by an infected tsetse with probability
&beta;<sub>L</sub>, incubate infection for a period of 1/tau<sub>L</sub> and are
infectious for a period of 1/&gamma;<sub>L</sub> and then immune for a period
of 1/&delta;<sub>L</sub>. Few concerns regarding Livestock modeling/dynamics:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do Livestock die from AAT/nagna ?
</li>
<li>Are we only treating Livestock as reservoir ? Then, do we need
full dynamics ?  <i>Not important for Boffa</i>.
</li>
</ul>

      In <a href="https://paperpile.com/shared/WLNoD5">Rogers (1990)</a> and <a href="https://paperpile.com/shared/GNiyWv">Rogers et al. (1994)</a>, they estimated birth
rates from ambient temperatures and overall density-independent
mortalities from observed changes in the population. The
important result of this approach was that it was always found
essential, for population stability, to include
density-dependent mortality in the model. <br  />
      <a href="https://paperpile.com/shared/6BUQur">Hargrove &amp; Williams (1998)</a> modeled adult tsetse mortality to be
a linear function of maximum temperature whose coefficients were
estimated by the optimized simulation procedure. Results from
this study supports indications from other work of the
overriding importance of temperature in controlling the
density-independent growth rates of tsetse populations.
</li>
<li><i>Models including migration:</i> <br  />
      <a href="https://paperpile.com/shared/02gCWq">Williams et al. (1992)</a> assumed diffusive movement and logistic growth,
making no assumption about the mode of operation of the
density-dependent processes, except that they applied only to
the birth and death processes, not to dispersal rates. In simple
terms, it was assumed that each population has a characteristic
carrying capacity and that the growth rate slows as this level
is approached. This approach has been used by <a href="https://paperpile.com/shared/e6UYRN">Hargrove (2000)</a> to
model the re-invasion of areas cleared of tsetse and by <br  />
      <a href="https://paperpile.com/shared/TJaTuk">Hargrove et al. (2000)</a> to model the use of insecticide-treated
livestock as a method of tsetse control. It could be used for
modeling observed changes in natural tsetse population, both
natural and as a consequence of human intervention.

<li>Do animals recover from AAT naturally ? or with treatment ? What
does <i>T.b.gambiense</i> do to animals ?
</li>

<li>In the human model equations, I added the rate by multiplying the
coverage with a treatment rate (1/duration of treatment). *Katie
suggested that since treatment occurs in a clinic (isolated
environment) so it is more reasonable to have it as rate of
seeking treatment.*
<b>Need to fix it.</b>

<li>Asymptomatic HAT cases in Humans: <br  />
    I found some information from <a href="https://paperpile.com/shared/MH5qHg">Checchi et al. 2008</a>.
It is a commonly held assumption that HAT always progresses to
stage 2, and is always fatal if untreated. However, the empirical
evidence to support this assumption is limited and at least
theoretically four "trypano=tolerant" alternative outcomes are
possible:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Early (within weeks/months) spontaneous resolution of stage I;
</li>
<li>Chronic, asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic carriage in stage
I without progressing to stage II;
</li>
<li>Progression to stage II followed by early spontaneous
resolution;
</li>
<li>Chronic, asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic carriage in stage
II <br  />
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Numerous hypotheses have been advanced to explain the persistence
 of HAT at low prevalence, despite years of case detection:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Constant reseeding with infections from outside the focus;
</li>
<li>The role of putative animal reservoirsl
</li>
<li>Existence of chronic, asymptomatic carriers, or cases of long
infection, which maintain low-level transmission, and once
control is relaxed, may lead to new outbreak. <br  />
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There was this famous "FEO" case of a Togolese female who
remained parasitaemic and healthy over 23 years of follow-up,
despite repeated treatment courses. The strain was
morphologically consistent with <i>T.b.gambiense</i>, but induced more
chronic infections in animals, and may have been non-gambiense.
</li>
<li>Reports of spontaneous infection clearance are rare.
<a href="https://paperpile.com/shared/jBoJoO">Harding and Hutchinson 1948</a> reported that 9 out of 75 Sierra
Leonean asymptomatic parasite-positive cases at baseline no
longer showed parasites in weekly tests over the next 2
months. In this community (Fuero), no significant mortality
attributable to HAT was noted in spite of infection attach rates
&gt; 25% over 3 years. The authors speculated that a novel strain
could have been responsible for the atypical outbreak in Fuero.
</li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Quelques+reflexions+sur+la+disparition+spontanee+des+trypanosomes+chez+trois+europeens+reconnus+porteurs+des+trypanosomes&author=Dyleff&publication_year=1932">Dyleff 1932</a> reported that 2 Europeans returning from French Congo, who were
positive for HAT at an initial test, subsequently tested
negative in all further tests in various laboratories.
</li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Course%252C+prognosis+and+classification+of+human+trypanosomiasis&btnG=&as_sdt=1%252C7&as_sdtp=">Barlovatz 1933</a>  described a patient from the Belgian Congo who refused
treatment. Three years and 3 months later, various tests,
including inoculation of six Guinea pigs with his blood, were
negative.
</li>
<li><a href="https://paperpile.com/shared/fcylov">Cooke et al. 1937</a> reported on an Englishman returning from Nigeria and Ghana who,
upon post-repatriation screening, was found to be infected but
mistakenly discharged without treatment; 6 months later no
trypanosomes were found in blood films or upo animal
inoculation. The patient was nonetheless treated as a
precaution.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Does human trpano-tolerance exist ?
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The majority of untreated gambiense HAT infections progress to
death.
</li>
<li>There is some evidence that patients can spontaneously recover
from stage I HAT infection. However, all such reports are from
West Africa, and may in fact involve different strain.
</li>
<li>There is no evidence that chronic carriage exists, although it
is biologically plausible. It is extremely difficult to study
this outcome given current diagnostic sensitivity and the
ethical requirement to treat all detected infections.
</li>
<li>If spontaneous cure or chronic do occur in stage I, they
probably constitute a minority of infections.
</li>
<li>There is no evidence for spontaneous cure from stage II.
</li>
<li>Infections either progress to stage II within a few years, or
not at all (as suggested by the absence of reports of very long
stage I infection in patients who have been away from
HAT-endemic areas for a known period).
</li>
<li>Duration of infection beyond 6-7 years are extremely rare.
